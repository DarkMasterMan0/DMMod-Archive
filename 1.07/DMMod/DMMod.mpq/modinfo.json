News 1 Title: "Patch 1.07 released 7-29-24"
News 1 Message: "As always, thanks for checking out my mod. This patch contains the final technical changelog that explains all the changes I do in the text files, it takes me a lot of time and energy to write these up for what's likely a very small group of people that read them. I'll only be writing simple patch notes onwards, anyone interested in the technical details can use a .txt comparison program to see the before and after."
News 2 Title: "Patch 1.07 Changelog Summary"
News 2 Message: "A massive amount of skill tooltip updates for increased accuracy/typo fixes, some significant changes to skills, some changes to sets and uniques. A couple bug fixes as well. I eventually plan on writing a fully up to date simple changelog that would include all current DMMod changes to make it easy to see what changed. I might also try to add an ingame menu that would show DMMod changes as well."
